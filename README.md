  ## Description 
  Team Profile Generator will generate you a html file with cards for all of your team members. It uses JEST, Inquirer, and node to complete this task for you. This application was built with an emphasis on object oriented programing, as well as TDD. The hardest part was grabbing the failing tests and transfering it on to a working function.
